<h1> The Fig Tree</h1>
&nbsp;
<p>
I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig 
tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't
 make up my mind which of the figs I would 
 choose. 
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
I wanted <em>each and every one</em> of them, but choosing one meant
<strong>;losing all the reast</strong>
 </p>
 
<hr>
<p>
    As i sat there, unable to decide, <br>
    the figs began to wrinkle and go black.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>What the figs represented</h2>
    <li> Different futures</li>
    <li> Different identities</li>
</p><li> Different lives</li>
</ol>
<h3> Why I couldnt choose</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fear of regret</li>
    <li>Fear of loss</li>
    <li>Fear of commitment</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Passage is by Sylvia Plath.
